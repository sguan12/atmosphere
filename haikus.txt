clear sky: warm, radiant sun. offers us a beaming smile. lights our world with joy.

partly cloudy: a shy ray of light, cautiously peeks through the clouds, stays partly hidden.

cloudy: gray and moody skies. there's no sun to be seen but, good photo lighting. 

thunderstorms: rain but with a flash. fierce lightning pierce the heavens. booming drums above.

showers: heavy raindrops fall. rest your eyes and listen close. nature's lullaby.

snow: white, frosty winter. icy crystals float gently. they melt in your hands.
